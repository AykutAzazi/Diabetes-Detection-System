## Diabetes-Detection-System
Diabetes Detection System(with machine learning and several important regression models)

Models:
* KNN
* Lojistic Regression
* SVC
* Gaussian Naive Bayes
* MLPClassifier
* DecisionTreeClassifier(CART)
* Random Forest Regression(RF)
* Gradient Boosting Machines(GBM)
* CATBoost,
* LightGBM
* XGBoost

### The Scenario of Project
We have been asked to build a model which we need to determine have diabetes or not for patients who come to the hospital.

### Dataset
